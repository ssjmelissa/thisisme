Hi there! You've reached my profile. Thanks for popping by. 
<br></br>

### The Name.
Melissa, but you can call me Mel.

### What I do. 
I am a sales development and enterprise business representative here at GitHub <i>(the place to be, if you ask me)</i> looking after APAC/ANZ customers within the corporate, mid-market, enterprise and federal government space. 🇦🇺

### Fun facts.
<ul>

<li> 🐕 I am a Golden Retriever mum. Sally will be thrilled she's getting a mention on my profile.</li>
<li> 🍵 I am a matcha enthusiast. Matcha everything. You name it, I'll take it.</li>
<li> 🤸 I do competitive All Star cheerleading. There's just something about being thrown in the air that makes me very happy. 
<li> 🏂 My favourite season of the year is Winter. Snowboarding, hot chocolate, and did I mention... Snowboarding?</li>
</ul>
